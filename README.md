# Linear-Regression-
An x86-64 assembly program that computes statistics of user-inputted numbers.

This program was apart of my CS218 (Intro to Systems Programming) class. The goal was to have a user be able to enter a certain amount of quaternary numbers and then have the program compute some basic statistics for these numbers. The program itself it not too complicated, but it emphasized the usage of buffers and stack memory management in the assembly level.

This program helped me learn more about what happens behind the scenes while a program runs. This includes understanding how functions work per the standard calling convention and how buffers are utilized when performing system services. As I continued to program in assembly, I have also largely improve my algorithm development skills due to how meticulous you have to be when writing code in assembly. This has made me more cautious during the algorithm planning stage in order to better plan out my programs before writing any code which has significantly decreased the amount of time spent debugging.
