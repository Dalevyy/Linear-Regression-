# Linear-Regression-
An x86-64 assembly program that computes statistics of user-inputted numbers.

This program was apart of my CS218 (Intro to Systems Programming) class. The goal was to have a user be able to enter a certain amount of quaternary numbers and then have the program compute some basic statistics for these numbers. The program itself it not too complicated, but it emphasized the usage of buffers and stack memory management in the assembly level.

This program helped me learn more about what happens behind the scenes while a program runs in regards to how functions are suppose to be called with the Standard Calling Convention and how buffers work to help with input and output operations. It also has improved my algorithm development skills due to how meticulous you have to be when writing assembly code, and I feel I have a better understanding of how my programs work.
